# Note_Taker
        
## Description

I was motivated in this challenge to have a page I can go to where I can take notes for class and daily reminiders in my life. The goal I wanted to complete was to be able to see previous notes by clicking on them, writing a new note and being able to delete old notes. I learned how to use helper functions that help me create a unique id for each note and another helper function that will help read the file, make the file and post it on the file. I also learned how to work with routes using GET and POST.
